# LIN1505-final-project

This was my final project for a computational linguistics class (LIN1505) that I took in Fall 2019 at the University of Toronto, taught by Barend Beekhuizen. Put very simply, the program, written in Python utilizing the spaCy dependency parser, extracts sentences of a particular lexical class with a particular syntax from the Corpus of Contemporary American English and writes them out to a .txt file. If you'd like to read a more detailed description of the motivation behind the project, please see the abstract included in this repository.
