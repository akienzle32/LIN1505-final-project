# LIN1505-final-project

This was my final project for a computational linguistics class (LIN1505) that I took in Fall 2019 at the University of Toronto, taught by Barend Beekhuizen. Put very simply, the program, written in Python utilizing the spaCy dependency parser, extracts sentences featuring verbs of a particular lexical class with a particular syntax from the Corpus of Contemporary American English and writes them out to a .txt file. For the project, I was interested in the syntactic alternation seen in (1)-(2). 

(1) Henry cleared all the dishes from the table.
(2) Henry cleared the table of all the dishes.

Ensuring that the program only extracted sentences with the right syntax was the main hurdle to be overcome in writing this script, but in the end the program worked nicely. If you'd like to read a more detailed description of the motivation behind the project, please see the abstract included in this repository.
